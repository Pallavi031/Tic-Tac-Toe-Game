<hr></hr>
<p>-We have a little button that says restart and all this is it's a table and it's a three by three table.But when you actually click on this You see an X and if you click on another square you get an 0 if you click twice.So it goes x Oh blank.<br />-So it's a very very simple project as far as any logic the only logic that's being done here is that when you click on something it'll end up cycling through the x.The Oh and the blank.If you click restart here it just refreshes and clears everything out.That's all you have to do for the tic tac toe project.</p>
